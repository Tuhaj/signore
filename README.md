Email signature manager/randomiser.

Usage
-----

signore lets you store email signatures, tag them, and retrieve them based on the provided tags (picking a signature randomly if more than one matches):

    $ signore prego tech
    // sometimes I believe compiler ignores all my comments
    $ signore prego tech
    You do have to be mad to work here, but it doesn’t help.
